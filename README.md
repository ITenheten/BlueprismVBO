# BlueprismVBO
Blueprism VBO collection

EWS API needs Microsoft.Exchange.WebServices.dll installed from msi or you can just put it in Blueprism folder and remove path to dll in references.
Only tested with on-premise Exchange.

Changes: 
Added shared mailbox support for EWS. (But not in a wrapper, because it might break simply switching VBOs)
